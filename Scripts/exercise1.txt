I used a python script I wrote (included as 1_caesar.py) to shift the alphabet 
according to the most common character in the ciphertext. The script shifts
assuming that the most common characters are either E, T, or A and printing all
three posibilities. I am then able to choose the one that appears to be
reasonable plaintext.
