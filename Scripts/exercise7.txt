Wrote and used a script (7_substitution.py) to find the frequency of letters in
the original text given in tess27.txt. Then found the frequency of letters in
the supplied ciphertext. Used these frequencies to create a simple mapping from
ciphertext back to plaintext. This still had a lot of issues, so I went through
the generated plaintext and switched out letters based on words that only had 
one or two incorrect letters. I kept repeating this process - running, 
checking, amending - until I had a complete (enough) map to discover the
complete plaintext.
