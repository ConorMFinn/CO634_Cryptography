Wrote another script here (4_4-6letterkey_vigenere). First used the EX3 script 
to work out it was a 6 letter key as the decyphered text got more legible. Then
had to find the 3rd most common letter in the excerpt, which turned out to be 
H, and combined it with the other two generated keys before generating all the
plaintexts, sorting by the "THE" frequency, and selecting the most reasonable
one.
